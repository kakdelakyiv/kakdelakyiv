        <h1>EUROMAIDAN</h1>
        <p>
            In the autumn of 2013 then president Viktor Yanukovych decides to strengthen ties with Russia instead of signing the promised association agreement with the European Union. 
            The indignation is enormous: for five months angry civilians occupy Maidan Nezalezhnosti; the Independence Square in the centre of Kyiv, after which the protests are called Euromaidan. 
            What started as a pro-Europe demonstration quickly turns into a public indictment of the country’s corrupted politics. The whole world is watching Kyiv. 
            In the spring of 2014 Yanukovych gives the riot police permission to open fire on protestors. Maidan’s hopeful blue-yellow turns the bleakest shade of red. About hundred people pass away. 
        </p>
        <h1>POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES</h1>
        <p>
            On February the 22nd of 2014 the parliament deposes of president Yanukovych. Current president Poroshenko, who supported the anti-government protests of Euromaidan from the first day, comes to power. 
            Russia does not acknowledge Kyiv’s new government. But also in the East and South of Ukraine, where the majority speaks Russian, not everyone is pleased with this new political orientation. Riots break out. 
            A few days later Russia invades the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea, that used to be part of the Russian Empire, and annexes it. 
            Consequently a military conflict between pro-Russian separatists, supported by the Russian army, and the Ukrainian army erupts. The war already costed more than 10 000 people’s lives. 
            Even though the fights in the East of Ukraine continue up until today, international attention has faded. Four and a half years after its start, the war remains deadlocked.
