    <h2>Vova Vorotniov (39), artist </h2>

    <p>
        “I consider myself a very individual artist, maybe lonely even. I don’t want to identify myself with any kind of group. I
        do not really appreciate those art, fashion, or techno circles. But at the same time I hang out with them, so I guess
        I also belong to them.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Vova Vorotniov is one of Ukraine’s most notable artists. He grew up in a working class family in Tchervonohrad, a small mining
        town in the West of Ukraine. “My parents love my work, even though they don’t understand it; they just think I’m
        mad.” Vova combines his background in both graffiti art and philosophy to explore the disappearing Soviet traces
        in society. “I kept the countercultural punk attitude from my graffiti period; I’m a very inclusive artist. I want
        my work to provoke a reaction in everyone, even if it’s about some very serious political matter.”

    </p>

    <p>
        For one of his last big projects Vova walked 1000 km from the West of Ukraine to the Donbass region in the East; the coal
        mining centre of the Russian Empire and later the main industrial region of the Soviet Union. During his walk he
        carried a piece of charcoal with him; now on display at a local history museum. With his trip he wanted to call attention
        to the Ukrainian art scene outside of Kyiv.

        “Kyiv is not functioning as a true art capital; it is merely imitating the Western ones without having any of their structures,”
        Vova explains. “For example: people set up exhibitions, but these don’t generate any sales, because there’s no budget
        for it. So you could even say there’s no point in showing your objects here.” In his work Vova treats the city itself
        as an object, instead of creating material objects of art.

    <h2>Stumbling in the dark </h2>

    <p>Having lived in Kyiv for 20 years now, Vova experienced Euromaidan from different perspectives.
        <br> Firstly, going to the Independence Square to join the protests; then working as a translator and fixer for the BBC.
        It’s an experience he has mixed feelings about.
    </p>
    <p>“Euromaidan was simplified by most Western media. Instead of digging deeper to understand what was truly going on here,
        they immediately called it a revolution. But that’s an empty label, directed by their own agenda.
        <br> The demonstrations were the result of a long process, dating back to the Orange revolution in 2004 [massive protests
        that caused the fraudulently elected Yanukovych to resign]. Ever since, a great number of Ukrainians expected we
        would join the EU. Of course it angered us that Yanukovych didn’t keep his promise: it proved that the government
        lost touch with the people and our needs. Euromaidan was about not letting our future be determined by one man and
        his caprices. But calling Euromaidan a mental revolution is naïve, and offensive. As if we had just been stumbling
        in the dark before."
    </p>

    <p>
        Strolling being his main working method, Vova is both flâneur and urban ethnographer. “I’m an outdoor artist because I am
        a poor artist”, Vova says while navigating the busy streets of central Kyiv. “I don’t have a studio, neither do I
        deliver any relevant product to the art market.”

    </p>

    <p>
        Nevertheless he also has to make a living, so Vova designs T-shirts and other merchandise with a humorous twist on both historical
        and current events. Today, for example, he is sporting a white shirt that displays the logo of the German far-left
        terrorist organisation Red Army Faction accompanied by the words “RAF Siemens”: a tongue-in-cheek reference to both
        the Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons, and the German electronics company Siemens.

    <h2>Exoticism</h2>
    <p>

        Occasionally Vova also collaborates with other artists, or fashion designers. At the shop of Ukrainian streetwear label Syndicate
        on Reitarska Street, the result of his latest collaboration is for sale. Vova’s capsule collection of two-tone sweaters,
        graphic-printed T-shirts, and polos is called “Ukrainian Avant-Garde”; as his main inspiration for it was the 20th
        century avant-garde of Kharkiv, in northeast Ukraine.

    </p>

    <p>
        “I am quite open for collaborations, even when I personally don’t appreciate most work that comes out of Kyiv’s art circles.
        But I also have little choice, living in a city like this. I hate and love it at the same time.”

    <blockquote>Titles such as the “new Berlin” say more about the exoticism this city exerts on western tourists, than about Kyiv itself</blockquote>

    <p>
        Strolling towards a few graffiti covered garage boxes amidst an oasis of green, Vova returns to his urban roots. He frequents
        this hidden hang-out since he joined the graffiti crew of Erase The City (ETC) as a teenager.
        <br> The city feels quite far away here, and yet the next metro stop is only a few minutes away. But it’s only a question
        of time as to when the wrecking ball takes it all down; real estate agents and developers are already quarrelling
        over the site.

    </p>

    <p>
        At a place like this it’s easy to see why parallels are being drawn between Berlin and Kyiv as edgy capitals of cool. Even
        so, titles such as the “new Berlin” say more about the exoticism this city exerts on western tourists, than about
        Kyiv itself. According to Vova, such exoticism is not harmless. “A lot of kids here are surfing on this post-Soviet
        fetish from the West, thereby idealizing an aesthetic which they have no clue about; they don’t know what it actually
        stood for.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As for Ukraine’s status in relation to the EU he’s rather uncertain. ‘“I am not simply pro-Europe and anti-Russia. Of course
        I feel closer to the European mentality, but that’s rather logical: to me, being Ukrainian means being European.
        But so far the EU has not put in a lot of effort to really help Ukraine. Once every while a few bureaucrats from
        Brussels visit Kyiv, but that’s about it. At the same time it is a very wrong, post-Cold War perspective to view
        Ukraine as a developing country. The EU is going through a massive identity crisis today; I don’t believe they are
        in the right position to tell us how everything should be done. Maybe Europe could learn something from Ukraine,
        instead of the other way around.”
