        “Making art about Euromaidan is boring, and opportunistic”

    <p>
        As the artist duo GAZ, lighting designer Vasiliy and sculptor Oleksii set up their studio in a a squat not far from the city.
        The grand early 20th century building hosts several artists as well. In the romantically unkept garden, and in the
        indoor workplaces, everything from woodwork to paintings to sculptures to light installations is on display.
        <br> Mutated working tools in plaster, such as a saw with two handles or scissors with handles only, decorate the walls
        of Vasiliy and Oleksii’s chaotic but cozy artists’ den. The tools carry names such as “Collective Responsibility”
        and “Brotherhood”; tongue in cheek references to international politics. “It’s all quite ironic”, Vasiliy explains
        in a playful manner that makes him seem younger than he actually is. “Above all we believe in the disarming potential
        of humour.”

    <h2>Lenin and borsch </h2>
    <p>
        Even though they like to keep the political references in their work light-hearted, the two artists were among the first
        to set-up camp at
        <i>Maidan Nezalezhnosti</i>, the Independence Square, when the protests broke out almost five years ago. “As an artist
        you have a certain responsibility,” Vasiliy believes.

        Oleksii, carrying his little baby girl in his arms, remembers how “obsessed” he became. “I couldn’t work, eat or sleep; Euromaidan
        was my life. We spent almost every day at the square, stood in the front row when the statue of Lenin was demolished.
        It was really important to be present, we felt a certain responsibility towards our country,” the sculptor explains.
        He recalls how surreal Kyiv felt during those four months. “Maidan was a battlefield, but at the same time daily
        life just went on. Lenin fell down, people got beaten up, but around the corner you could still eat your borsch in
        a fancy restaurant.”

        Vasiliy: “Euromaidan was not so much about obtaining a European passport as it was a battle against authoritarianism. If
        we would have accepted one man to decide over all of our fates, who knows where we would find ourselves today? Geographically
        and historically Ukraine has always been caught between different civilizations. Being Ukrainian means being multicultural;
        open to the world in all its diversity. This never used to be a problem, until it was artificially implemented from
        above. Take the example of the Soviet Union: Ukrainians were used to a sense of ownership; communism was unnatural
        for us. Up until today our country still struggles to replace the Soviet heritage with our own worthy alternative.”

    <h2>Instrumentalisation</h2>
    <p>
        Despite their active participation in the protests both artists are rather skeptical about art that thematises Euromaidan
        and its political aftermath. “It’s boring,” Oleksii believes. “And opportunistic,” Vasily chips in. “Suddenly every
        other artist is doing a project about the revolution, or about the war in the East. Because that’s where the money
        is. But it is too early to assess the real changes brought by the revolution; these things take more time.” Oleksii:
        “I was propositioned to make a sculpture in commemoration of the so-called Heavenly Hundred - the protesters who
        got killed during Euromaidan- but I declined. I don’t want to be instrumentalized by the government just like artists
        were in Soviet times.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The sculptor believes the influence of Euromaidan on his own work to be more implicit. “My piece “Fixation” from 2014, for
        example, couldn’t have been created without the energy I got from the protests. Euromaidan helped me to set my priorities;
        to stay free. But I am still processing everything that happened - the biggest blow is probably yet to come. The
        same goes for the war: that we don’t talk much about it here in Kyiv, doesn’t mean we don’t think about it every
        day. I mean, it’s impossible not to.”

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Maidan is a work in progress, Vasiliy also believes. “Without the protests we would now be living in a Soviet Union 2.0.”
        Today the lighting designer is more sure about his identity. “I have very mixed roots: my family hails from Moldavia,
        Romania, Italy, and Ukraine. As a kid I spent all my summers in a chaotic mishmash of languages; my schoolmates used
        to bully me for it. Before Euromaidan I didn’t question my identity too much, but now I am confident and proud to
        be Ukrainian. Not in a nationalist way; it’s more a healthy kind of patriotism.”

    <h2>Post-Soviet hype</h2>

    <p>
        Since Euromaidan western tourists have become increasingly interested in Kyiv as a destination; a development that matches
        the recent hype around everything coming out of the so-called post-Soviet countries. Though “post-Soviet” is a label
        Vasiliy does not appreciate much. “Celebrating Soviet heritage and aesthetics means celebrating a system that killed
        50 million people, including 10 million Ukrainians. This glorification creates a positive image of the USSR that
        never existed.
        <br>This hype is built on the rip-off of other cultures. During Soviet times Russia stole a lot from other countries,
        and claimed this heritage was theirs. In a way Moscow today still considers itself the gravitational centre: pulling
        all the arts and culture from its neighbours towards itself, presenting it to the world as one big post-Soviet waffle.
        It’s a smart propaganda strategy to reclaim the culture of other countries.”
