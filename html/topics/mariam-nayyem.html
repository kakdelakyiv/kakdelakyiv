    <blockquote>“I had hoped for a more democratic system, but we got war instead”</blockquote>
    <p>Though she makes elegant paintings and drawings, Mariam does not want to call herself a “real artist”. “I earn my income
        through graphic design, not art.” With big, brown eyes that cast a piercing gaze, Mariam bears some resemblance to
        the Ukrainian born American actress Mila Kunis; albeit, though born in Ukraine, she has Afghan roots. She radiates
        an air of determination; Mariam knows what she believes in. “I’m a feminist”, she states by way of introduction,
        before digressing to a story about walking around Kyiv in hijab for 10 days by way of performance art and simultaneous
        social experiment.

        Today Mariam still paints, though she now mostly uses the streets as her canvas. Equipping the trees of Taras Shevchenko
        Park with a set of big, blue eyes she explains why she stopped making art “in a classic way”. “After Euromaidan,
        and even more so when the war started, my work became really dark. But no one is interested in sad art; we already
        have more than enough of that. So I turned to graphic design; a safer option for me now.”

    <h2>Tired and disappointed</h2>
    <p>
        Mariam’s brother Masi, a well-known lawyer, spent one year at the frontline in the East, where he got severely injured. “He
        was tricked into the army”, Mariam says, “everyone is bribing their way out of military service, but out of all people
        they caught him.” She believes her family paid a high price for having her other brother, Mustafa, unofficially starting
        the Euromaidan protests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back then, Mustafa was an investigative journalist for the news site
        <i>Ukrainian Pravda</i>, had called on his Facebookfriends to join him at the
        <i>Maidan Nezalezhnosti</i> square if they also disagreed with the decision of their president to strengthen ties with
        Russia instead of signing the EU association agreement. Consequently, the protests were a trying time for the Nayyem
        family. “We received a lot of threats. I was warned not to go out on the streets by myself”, Mariam says.

        “After Euromaidan and the war, my work became really dark. But no one is interested in sad art”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Almost five years later Mustafa is a member of the Ukrainian parliament who has dedicated himself to fighting corruption.
        Needless to say, his reform minded opinions are not appreciated by everyone. “I believe good art should be anonymous”,
        Mariam says. “But that’s not possible anymore for me. Everyone knows my brothers.”
        <br> Tired and disappointed, those are the main feelings Mariam was left with after Euromaidan. “I had hoped for a more
        democratic system, instead we got war. If someone would have told me five years ago that Ukraine would soon be a
        country at war, I would have never believed it. But the longer the war goes on, the more the dead become just a number.”
    </p>
    <p>
        At first the capital, almost six hundred kilometers away from the front, seemed like a secure bubble to Mariam. But since
        family friend and critical journalist Pavel Sheremet died from a car bomb explosion, in the middle of Kyiv in July
        2016, Mariam does not think of Kyiv as a safe space anymore.

    <h2>Half-blood</h2>
    <p>
        What about the European Union, could they do more for Ukraine? “Ukraine shouldn’t rely on Europe right now,” Mariam thinks.
        “We are not a priority; the EU has its own problems. After all, Europe is not our parent that can solve all our difficulties.
        It’s all up to us Ukrainians.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Being born and raised in Ukraine, Mariam, in stark contrast to her brothers, who were born in Afghanistan, never felt she
        was a valid member of this society. Mariam calls the question of Ukrainian identity the struggle of her life. Even
        though she really wanted to belong, she never felt like she did. “During my teens I was even wearing traditional
        Ukrainian dresses to prove my Ukrainian-ness. I know that I’m Ukrainian, but because of how I look others have often
        made it clear that I am only a “half-blood”, as they say in Harry Potter.”

    <p>
        Even though the Ukrainian situation looks bleak, Mariam still believes her generation will bring about much needed change.
        Having witnessed her own friends getting more and more politically engaged she is quite optimistic, albeit an optimism
        drenched in realism: “there’s no other option - change, or lose your mind.”
