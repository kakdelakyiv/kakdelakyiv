        “I was never really into politics, but when politics come to your door, you have little choice but to participate.” Masha
        Reva is an internationally renowned fashion designer and artist, hailing from the port city of Odessa in the South
        of Ukraine. Before she dedicated herself fully to her own label, she worked for big designers such as Walter Van
        Beirendonck in Antwerp, and Takoon Studio in New York.

        Masha’s self renovated flat, that serves simultaneously as her studio, is situated at less than fifteen minutes walking from
        Maidan Nezalezhnosti: the Independence Square in the centre of Kyiv that was occupied for four months during the
        Euromaidan protests. “That period is inscribed in my memory as a very intense, emotional period”, Masha remembers.
        “From my living room I could hear the gunshots. In the beginning I just went to Maidan to observe people building
        tent camps, but it didn’t take long before I felt obliged to engage myself. I was fascinated by the energy of all
        these people so desperately trying to build something out of nothing. My friends and I are still processing what
        happened back then; we don’t fully grasp it yet.”

    <h2>United</h2>
    <p>What does it mean to be young and Ukrainian, almost five years after the collective civil fury of Euromaidan? “What struck
        me most at these protests, was the enormous amount of people all striving for the same goal. I had never seen that”,
        Masha says over a cup of coffee and a cigarette in her kitchen. “Before Euromaidan our generation was not really
        united, that’s all changed now. Back then we did not take our national identity too seriously, were sometimes even
        ashamed to admit we were from Ukraine; a post-Soviet country that was not performing well on different levels. I
        remember how my teachers at Central Saint Martin’s in London used to joke they had never even heard of Ukraine. Before,
        all my friends wanted to move abroad. Even my parents, who used to spend their last money on traveling, urged me
        to stay in London. It was a chance coincidence I was in Kyiv when the demonstrations started; I was taking a sabbatical,
        unsure whether I wanted to continue working in fashion. Because of all the positive changes I saw around me I decided
        to stay here. People opened up, started their own businesses. We have so much more cool places to go to today. A
        lot of people who wanted to leave, stayed; as I did.”

    <p>At the wall of Masha’s living room hangs a series of aquarelles with Picasso-like women. Selling price for these sketches:
        250 euros per piece. No, Masha has no complaints about her income.

    <p>Masha: “Probably I would earn more if I was still living in London. But thanks to Instagram where you are based is becoming
        less and less important; as long as your work is good. I don’t regret my decision. The energy of this city and its
        people is truly unique.”

    <h2>Field of Miracles
    </h2>

    <p>After having lived in Europe herself, Masha is convinced that Kyiv, despite its precarious economics, has more space
        for creative renewal. </p>

    <p>“Europe is too perfect for me: cities such as London or Paris were ‘finished’ already a long time ago. But Europe’s supposed
        perfection is under a lot of pressure today. One of the reasons is the huge influx of refugees, and the way some
        countries are struggling to receive them. A lot of artists and free spirits from western Europe now desire other
        cultures to escape to; they are looking for something new. And they seem to have found it here, in the Post-Soviet
        countries.”

        Masha’s friend Dima joins her for a last cigarette in her kitchen. Dima is a musician she met recently, at one of the parties
        she likes to throw at her spacious apartment. Today they plan to take a trip to the left bank of the Dnieper River;
        to the market of Lesnaya.
    </p>

    <p>This spectacularly low-budget fair is a good example of the recent attraction that Kyiv exerts on westerners. Half an
        hour from the city center with the immodest rattling subway, eastern exoticism lurks at a chaotically large bazaar
        where you can find anything from homemade dried peaches to Versace pants for less than 60 hryvnia, or two euros.
        Provided you have the patience for it. </p>

    <p>“Welcome to the real Ukraine”, Dima says while walking past a row of wrinkled old ladies selling flowers, heading for
        the so-called Field Of Miracles, where everything costs only one or two hryvnia.

    <p>“When my friends from the fashion industry come to visit me in Kyiv, they always bring an empty suitcase to fill it here”,
        says Masha while delving into a pile of second hand clothes, searching for inspiring pieces of clothing. </p>

    <p>“Everything here is a little wilder, a tad rawer. The traces from Soviet times are still visible in the streets. As kids
        this Soviet stuff was little romantic to us, but westerners seem to find it fascinating. Be that as it may, the current
        enthusiasm of my foreign friends makes me even more proud to be Ukrainian.”
