    <h2>Masha Reva (30), fashion designer and artist </h2>
    <p>
        “I was never really into politics, but when politics comes to your door, you have little choice but to participate.” Masha
        Reva is an internationally renowned fashion designer and artist, hailing from the port city of Odessa in southern
        Ukraine. Before she dedicated herself fully to her own label, she worked for big designers such as Walter Van Beirendonck
        in Antwerp, and Takoon Studio in New York.

        Masha’s self-renovated flat, which doubles as her studio, is situated less than a fifteen minutes walk from
        <i>Maidan Nezalezhnosti</i>
        - the Independence Square in the centre of Kyiv that was occupied by angry citizens for four months during the Euromaidan
        protests. “That period is inscribed in my memory as a very intense, emotional period,” Masha remembers. “From my
        living room I could hear the gunshots. In the beginning I just went to Maidan to observe people building tent camps,
        but it didn’t take long before I felt obliged to engage myself. I was fascinated by the energy of all these people
        so desperately trying to build something out of nothing. My friends and I are still processing what happened back
        then; we don’t fully grasp it yet.”

    <h2>United</h2>
    <p>What does it mean to be young and Ukrainian, almost five years after the collective civic outrage of Euromaidan? “What
        struck me most at these protests was the enormous amount of people all striving for the same goal. I had never seen
        that,” Masha says over a cup of coffee and a cigarette in her kitchen. “Before Euromaidan our generation was not
        really united. That’s all changed now. Back then we did not take our national identity too seriously, we were sometimes
        even ashamed to admit we were from Ukraine, a post-Soviet country that was not performing well on different levels.
        I remember how my teachers at Central Saint Martin’s in London used to joke they had never even heard of Ukraine.
        Before, all my friends wanted to move abroad. Even my parents, who used to spend the last of their money on traveling,
        urged me to stay in London.
    </p>
    <p>It was a chance coincidence I was in Kyiv when the demonstrations started; I was taking a sabbatical, unsure whether
        I wanted to continue working in fashion. Because of all the positive changes I saw around me I decided to stay here.
        People opened up, started their own businesses. We have so many more cool places to go to today. A lot of people
        who wanted to leave, stayed; as I did.” </p>

        On the wall of Masha’s living room hangs a series of aquarelles with Picasso-like drawings of women. Selling price for these
        sketches: 250 euros per piece. No, Masha does not have any complaints about her income.

        Masha: “Probably, I would earn more if I was still living in London. But thanks to Instagram your geographical location is
        becoming less and less important; as long as your work is good. I don’t regret my decision. The energy of this city
        and its people is truly unique.”

    <h2>Field of Miracles
    </h2>

    <p>
        Having lived in Europe herself, Masha is convinced that Kyiv, despite its precarious economics, has more space for creative
        renewal.

        “Europe is too perfect for me: cities such as London or Paris were already finished a long time ago. But Europe’s supposed
        perfection is under a lot of pressure today. One of the reasons is the huge influx of refugees, and the way some
        countries are struggling to receive them. A lot of artists and free spirits from Western Europe now desire other
        cultures to escape to; they are looking for something new. And they seem to have found it here, in the Post-Soviet
        countries.”

        Masha’s friend Dima joins her for a last cigarette in her kitchen. Dima is a musician she met recently, at one of the parties
        she likes to throw at her spacious apartment. Today they plan to take a trip to the left bank of the Dnieper River,
        to the market of Lesnaya.
    </p>

    <p>
        This spectacularly low-budget fair is a good example of the recent attraction that Kyiv exerts on westerners. Half an hour
        from the city centre with the immodest rattling metro, eastern exoticism lurks at a chaotically large bazaar where
        you can find anything from homemade dried peaches to Versace pants for less than 60 hryvnia, or two euros. Provided
        you have the patience for it.

        “Welcome to the real Ukraine”, Dima says while walking past a row of wrinkled old ladies selling flowers, heading for the
        so-called Field Of Miracles, where everything costs only one or two hryvnia.

    <p>“When my friends from the fashion industry come to visit me in Kyiv, they always bring an empty suitcase to fill it here”,
        says Masha while delving into a pile of second hand clothes, searching for inspiring pieces of clothing. </p>

    <p>“Everything here is a little wilder, more raw. The traces from Soviet times are still visible in the streets. As kids
        this Soviet stuff was not very romantic to us, but westerners seem to find it fascinating. Be that as it may, the
        current enthusiasm of my foreign friends makes me even more proud to be Ukrainian.”
