        Born and raised in the previously Autonomous Republic of Crimea that Russia annexed in 2014 Anton Romanov carries the label
        of “Internally Displaced Person”. As an openly gay and politically engaged theatre director who had co-organized
        the demonstrations in support of Euromaidan, he was forced to flee the peninsula. Life in his hometown Simferopol
        had simply become too dangerous. After moving around for two years he ended up in Kyiv.

        “It was the most surreal feeling. One morning the Russian tricolour was billowing from the Parliament’s roof, and I realized
        I had just woken up in a different country. During the Russian occupation I provided locked-in Ukrainian soldiers
        with food and clothes. One of my Facebook posts in which I called out for help was shared by Pravy Sektor, a nationalist
        Ukrainian political party founded during Euromaidan. Because of that the Russian state officially declared me a terrorist.
        Of course they were just seeking for any kind of justification to expel all nonconformists. After I received my first
        death threat I was frightened, yes. But today… Even when I take my performances to the frontline in the East, I am
        not scared anymore, even though I have witnessed quite some heavy stuff there. It’s peculiar how fast you get used
        to fear.”

    <h2>Not an easy child
    </h2>

    <p>Growing up in a middle class family, Anton always had a strong opinion of his own. Not afraid to voice his beliefs he
        often clashed with the more conservative minds around him. Nonetheless he never gave in to the pressure to conform.
        “Always getting into some trouble, I was not an easy child to my parents. My strong political convictions used to
        differ a great deal from my dad’s; who was pro-Russian. Though in recent years he has changed his opinions. Being
        outspoken about my sexuality also contributed to my outsider status. At the TV station I was working for, people
        used to make fun of me. But I survived, as I always did. My theatre colleagues however never made a problem out of
        it, not at all. Just like my parents; despite our differences they supported me in everything, which I am very grateful
        for.

    <p>One of my sisters is openly gay as well. She and her partner are living together with their four adoptive children in
        Simferopol for some time now. But their cohabitation has become significantly more difficult now Crimea finds itself
        under Russian law with all its anti-gay propaganda.”

    <h2>Paradoxes</h2>
    <p>
        Before Euromaidan and the ensuing annexation and war, Anton used to direct plays about love “and other naïve topics”. Today
        he feels these themes don’t match his reality anymore. His pieces he are more radical, more political; but nonetheless
        very personal. The personal is political, today more than ever. “I exist of paradoxes: I am openly gay, but raised
        with the values of orthodox Catholicism, my parents are Russian but I consider myself a Crimean Ukrainian in the
        first place, and on top of that I am making theatre that is not accepted by the establishment as theatre; non-theatre.”
        All these conflicting characteristics are articulated in Anton’s Identity Map / Hate Speech performance; or rather
        anti-performance.

    <h2>The personal is political, today more than ever</h2>

    <p>For the past two years Anton has toured different cities, both in- and outside of Ukraine, with this piece in which he
        presents himself naked and alone on the stage. He provides his audience with the details of his personal conflicts,
        first asking them to write the most offending words they ever heard on his bare body, later demanding they carve
        out with a tiny needle the insults they find themselves guilty of. “I want my audience to take responsibility”, Anton
        explains. “Politically I won’t change anything with my performances, I am aware of that. Nevertheless I feel like
        I must carry on. There’s no other option.”
    </p>
    <p>His (anti)performance is in Ukrainian only, even though his mother tongue is Russian. A clear statement: “Since the Russian
        tanks in Crimea claimed they wanted to free us from the pressure of speaking Ukrainian, I find it hard to express
        myself in the language of the oppressor. My boyfriend and I therefore switched from Russian to Ukrainian for our
        daily communication.”

    <h2>Christian activists</h2>

    <p>The day before Anton was about to stage his Hate Speech performance at PostPlay; an indie theater he co-founded at the
        border of the quickly gentrifying area of Podol, a friend wrote him that Christian activists were planning to obstruct
        this “immoral” performance. Anton had just shrugged off his friend’s warning. At the day of the performance, there
        are no Christian activists to be seen. It was this performance that brought Anton to Europe for the first time. Quite
        a disenchantment, he admits. “I had an idealized idea of life in the EU. Yet facing the reality of a continent where
        xenophobia and homophobia are on the rise, I grew disappointed. I ran away from right wing radicals, why would I
        want to join a union that increasingly tolerates them?”

    <h2>Cute countryside house</h2>

    <p>Nonetheless he still hopes for a quick Ukrainian membership of the European Union. “In Ukraine the number of assaults
        against people with different sexualities and even different opinions is still a lot higher. For me, the EU stands
        for the protection of minorities and their rights.” Another important reason is of course the condition of same-sex
        marriage. Anton and his boyfriend Sasha have been together for four years now; they would love to get married and
        grow old together. But not in Kyiv, rather in a cute little house on the Crimean countryside; Ukrainian Crimea, that
        is. “Kiev does not really feel like home. Sooner or later the occupation will end, and we will return. I am convinced
        of that.”
