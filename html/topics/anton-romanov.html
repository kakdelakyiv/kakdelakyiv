        After Russia annexed the previously Autonomous Republic of Crimea, a peninsula in the South of Ukraine, Anton Romanov (33)
        was forced to flee. Moving to Kyiv, he became an internally displaced person. As an openly gay and politically engaged
        theatre director life in the Crimean capital Simferopol, his hometown, had simply become too dangerous for him. "It
        was the most surreal feeling. One morning instead of the usual Ukrainian flag the Russian tricolour was billowing
        from the Parliament’s roof, and I realized I had just woken up in a different country. I had co-organised protests
        to support the Euromaidan revolution that was happening in Kyiv, and after Russia invaded our peninsula I provided
        locked-in Ukrainian soldiers with food and clothes. One of my Facebook posts in which I called out for help on this
        matter was shared by "Pravy Sektor", a nationalist Ukrainian political party founded during Euromaidan. Because of
        that the Russian state officially declared me a terrorist. Of course they were just seeking for any kind of justification
        to expel all nonconformists. In the beginning the death threats I received frightened me. But living with fear is
        something you get peculiarly fast accustomed to. Now I don’t care anymore. Even when I take my theatre projects to
        the front line in the East of Ukraine, where I’ve witnessed some very heavy stuff, I don’t feel scared."

        Growing up in a middle class family (?) in Simferopol, Anton always had a strong opinion of his own. Not afraid to voice
        his beliefs he often clashed with the more conservative minds around him. Nonetheless he never gave in to the pressure
        to conform. "Always getting into some trouble, I was not an easy child to my parents. My strong political convictions
        used to differ a great deal from my dad’s; who was pro-Russian. Though in recent years he has changed his opinions.
        Being outspoken about my sexuality also contributed to my outsider status. At the TV station I was working for, people
        used to make fun of me. But I survived, as I always did. My theatre colleagues however never made a problem out of
        it, not at all. Just like my parents; despite our differences they supported me in everything, which I am very grateful
        for. One of my sisters is openly gay as well. She and her partner are living together with their four adoptive children
        in Simferopol for some time now, but doing so has become significantly more difficult now Crimea finds itself under
        Russian law and all its anti-gay propaganda."

            Before Euromaidan and the ensuing annexation of Crimea and war in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, Anton used to direct
            plays about love "and other cute but naïve topics". Today he feels these themes don’t match his reality anymore.
            The pieces he directs and performs are more radical, more political; but nonetheless very private. The personal
            has become political, if it had not always been. "I exist of paradoxes: being gay but raised with the values
            of orthodox Catholicism that condemns homosexuality, identifying as a Crimean Ukrainian but speaking Russian
            as my mother tongue, and making theatre that is not accepted by the establishment as theatre." All these conflicting
            characteristics are articulated in Anton’s "Identity Map / Hate Speech" performance. Or rather anti-performance;
            as he describes his own genre as "non-theatre". 
            For the past two years he has toured different cities, both in-
            and outside of Ukraine, with this piece in which he presents himself naked and alone on the stage. He provides
            his audience with a lot of personal information, first asking them to write the most offending words they ever
            heard on his bare body, later demanding they should carve out with a tiny needle the insults which they already
            used to describe someone. "I want my audience to take responsibility", Anton explains. "Politically I won’t change
            anything with my performances, I am aware of that. Nevertheless I feel like I have to carry on. There’s no other
            option." His (anti)performance is in Ukrainian, as Anton is transitioning from thinking and talking in his mother
            tongue Russian to Ukrainian, his second language. An unmistakable statement: "Ever since the Russian tanks rolled
            into Simferopol, claiming they would "free" the inhabitants of Crimea from the so-called pressure of having to
            speak Ukrainian, it became hard, if not to say impossible for me to speak Russian."

        A few days before Anton was about to stage his Hate Speech performance at Postplay; an indie theater co-founded by Anton
        close to the regenerated area of Podol, a friend wrote him that christian activists deemed his piece "immoral" and
        planned to obstruct its performance. Anton just shrugged off his friend’s warning. At the day of the performance,
        none of the christian activists turned up.

        "Before I took my performances to Europe, I used to have an idealised image of it", Anton admits. "Yet facing the reality
        of a continent where xenophobia and homophobia are on the rise again, I grew disappointed. I ran away from right
        wing radicals, why would I want to join a union that increasingly tolerates them? Nevertheless the number of assaults
        against queers and even feminists in Ukraine is still a lot higher, so of course I wish for us to become part of
        the European Union. To me the EU stands for the protection of human rights, and thus the protection of minority groups
        and their rights." Before Ukraine could join the European Union the question about the legal status of same-sex marriages
        would have to be solved; another reason why Anton hopes for a swift membership of the EU. He would love to marry
        his boyfriend Sasha, whom he has been with for four years now, and move away from Kyiv. Because even though he and
        his boyfriend share a comfortable flat in ... , a greener outskirt of Kyiv, the city still does not quite feel like
        home to them. The couple dreams of growing old together in a cute, little house on the Crimean countryside. That
        is to say; the Ukrainian Crimean countryside. Because Anton firmly believes that Ukraine will win his beloved peninsula
        back. "If not sooner, than later. But I will return home, there is no doubt about that."
