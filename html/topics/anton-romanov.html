    <h2>Anton Romanov (33), theatre director and performer</h2>
    <p>
        In 2014 Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which was historically part of The Russian Empire and the Russian
        region of the Soviet Union, until transferred to Ukraine in 1954. Born and raised in Crimea, Anton Romanov today
        carries the label of “Internally Displaced Person”. As an openly gay and politically engaged theatre director who
        had co-organized the demonstrations in support of Euromaidan, he was forced to flee the peninsula. Life in his hometown,
        Simferopol, had simply become too dangerous. After moving around for two years he ended up in Kyiv.
    </p>
    <p>
        “It was the most surreal feeling. One morning the Russian tricolour was billowing from the Parliament’s roof, and I realized
        I had just woken up in a different country. During the Russian occupation I provided locked-in Ukrainian soldiers
        with food and clothes. One of my Facebook posts in which I called out for help was shared by Pravy Sektor [Right
        Sector], a nationalist Ukrainian political party founded during Euromaidan. Because of that the Russian state officially
        declared me a terrorist. Of course they were just seeking any kind of justification to expel all nonconformists.


    </p>
    <p>“After I received my first death threat I was frightened, yes. But today … Even when I take my performances to the frontline
        in the East, I am not scared anymore, even though I have witnessed quite a lot of heavy stuff there. It’s strange
        how fast you get used to fear.”</p>

    <h2>Not an easy child
    </h2>

    <p>Growing up in a middle class family, Anton always had strong opinions. Not afraid to voice his beliefs, he often clashed
        with the more conservative minds around him. Nonetheless he never gave in to the pressure to conform. “Always getting
        into some trouble, I was not an easy child for my parents. My strong political convictions used to differ a great
        deal from my dad’s, as he was pro-Russian. Though in recent years he has changed his opinions.
    </p>

    <p>“Being outspoken about my sexuality also contributed to my outsider status. At the TV station I was working for, people
        used to make fun of me. But I survived, as I always did. My theatre colleagues however never made a problem out of
        it, not at all. Just like my parents; despite our differences they supported me in everything, which I am very grateful
        for.
    </p>

    <p>“One of my sisters is openly gay as well. She and her partner are living together with their four adopted children in
        Simferopol for some time now. But their cohabitation has become significantly more difficult now Crimea finds itself
        under Russian law with all its anti-gay propaganda.”</p>

    <h2>Paradoxes</h2>
    <p>
        Before Euromaidan and the ensuing annexation and war, Anton used to direct plays about love “and other naïve topics”. Today
        he feels these themes don’t match his reality anymore. His pieces are more radical, more political; but nonetheless
        very personal. Today, more than ever, the personal is political.
    </p>

    <p>“I exist as a paradox: I am openly gay, but raised with the values of Orthodox Catholicism; my parents are Russian but
        I consider myself a Crimean Ukrainian in the first place; and on top of that I am making theatre that is not accepted
        by the establishment as theatre.” All these conflicting characteristics are articulated in Anton’s
        <i>Identity Map / Hate Speech</i> performance; or rather anti-performance.</p>

    <h2>Today, more than ever, the personal is political</h2>

    <p>For the past two years Anton has toured different cities, both in- and outside of Ukraine, with this piece, in which
        he presents himself naked and alone on the stage. He provides his audience with the details of his personal conflicts,
        first asking them to write the most offending words they ever heard on his bare body, later demanding they carve
        out with a tiny needle the insults they find themselves guilty of. “I want my audience to take responsibility,” Anton
        explains. “Politically I won’t change anything with my performances, I am aware of that. Nevertheless I feel like
        I must carry on. There’s no other option.”
    </p>
    <p>His (anti)performance is in Ukrainian only, even though his mother tongue is Russian. For him, it is a clear statement
        of his beliefs: “Since the Russian soldiers in Crimea claimed they wanted to free us from the pressure of speaking
        Ukrainian, I find it hard to express myself in the language of the oppressor. My boyfriend and I therefore switched
        from Russian to Ukrainian for our daily communication.”

    <h2>Christian activists</h2>

    <p>The day before Anton was to stage his
        <i>Hate Speech</i> performance at PostPlay - an indie theater he co-founded on the margins of the quickly gentrifying
        area of Podol in Kyiv - a friend wrote him that Christian activists were planning to obstruct this “immoral” performance.
        Anton shrugged off his friend’s warning. On the day of the performance, there were no Christian activists to be seen.

    </p>

    <p>Not so long ago Anton performed his
        <i>Hate Speech</i> piece in Germany, it was the first time he visited a European country. Quite a disenchantment, he
        admits. “I had an idealized idea of life in the EU. Yet facing the reality of a continent where xenophobia and homophobia
        are on the rise, I grew disappointed. I ran away from right-wing radicals, why would I want to join a Union that
        increasingly tolerates them?”

    <h2>Cute country-house</h2>

    <p>Nonetheless he still hopes for quick Ukrainian membership of the European Union. “In Ukraine the number of assaults against
        people with different sexualities and even different opinions is a lot higher than within the EU. Even if right-wing
        ideas or on the rise in Europe, I still believe that the EU stands for the protection of minorities and their rights.”

    </p>

    <p>Another important reason is of course the issue of same-sex marriage. Anton and his boyfriend Sasha have been together
        for four years now; they would love to get married and grow old together. But not in Kyiv. Rather, in a cute little
        house in the Crimean countryside; a Crimea that belongs to Ukraine again, that is. “Kiev does not really feel like
        home. Sooner or later the occupation will end, and we will return. I am convinced of that.”</p>
