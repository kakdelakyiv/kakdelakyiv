    <h2>Evgenia Vidischeva (22), theatre director and curator </h2>
    <p>
        Evgenia, Zhenya to friends, lives in one of the concrete high-rises in the notorious district of Troeshina, situated on the
        left bank of the Dneiper. Without any adequate public transport connections to the rest of the city, it takes some
        time - or a taxi - to get to Troeshina. This is the place where Evgenia’s grandparents emigrated to from Russia during
        the post-war years. Her grandfather worked several years on Kyiv’s thermal power plant, and was rewarded for his
        efforts with an apartment in Troeshina.

    <p>
        Here Evgenia, an easy going girl with blue highlights, grew up, and still shares a small flat with her mom. But most importantly,
        this is also the place where she and her friends gather, to prepare their next performances or workshops.

        She is aware of the prejudices people harbour against her neighborhood, yet she does not agree with them. “They think Troeshina
        is too far away, too criminal; a dead outskirt where nothing interesting happens. But my house is like an office
        to me and my friends: this is where we work, create and spend our free time.” In that sense the young director even
        sees the remote location of their rehearsal space - her bedroom - as an advantage. “It helps us to focus on what
        really matters.”

    <h2>Red carpet</h2>

    <p>
        Before Euromaidan, Evgenia had dreamed of emigrating to the United States to pursue her own American Dream of making it as
        an actress. “I already imagined myself in Hollywood, strolling over that red carpet. And receiving the Oscar for
        best actress, of course.”
    </p>

    <p>But then Euromaidan happened. The protests not only transformed the city, but also Evgenia’s mindset. “Maidan symbolized
        an ideal civil society for me. I would go out of the metro and want to hug everyone on the street. I realised I want
        to be here, in Ukraine, and nowhere else. I want to build up a better country. I want to make theatre, and help arts
        and culture flourish.” Evgenia claims that a lot of problems in Ukraine sprout from an inadequate education system
        and the lack of modern art. “A lot of Ukrainians do not have good access to culture, but people need to understand
        that art makes the world richer.”

    <h2>Change from below
    </h2>

    <p>
        After the revolution Evgenia became involved with the independent
        <i>PostPlay</i> theater. She believes that modern theater can and should address “real problems” in its own language.
        Unexpectedly, at the age of 20, she even received the responsibility of directing several plays at this theater.
        Today, Evgenia balances her time between her work as an independent theater director and curator of a travelling
        socio-cultural project for teenagers, called
        <i>VIDLIK</i>.

    <blockquote>“I believe teenagers are like spring: they are the ones who can let Ukraine blossom, who will be defining our society
        in 15 years”
    </blockquote>

    <p>

        The aim of this grassroots project, which has no financial support, is “to inspire, not to educate”. All the directors, actors
        and urbanists involved have invested their own money from other jobs.
        <i>VIDLIK</i> bring theater workshops to remote towns all over Ukraine, some of them very close to the conflict zone
        in Donbass. By doing so Evgenia and her friends want to motivate teenagers to actively transform cultural life in
        their small towns.

    </p>
    <p>
        Evgenia believes that change in Ukraine will need to come from below, and thus the future of the country is in the hands
        of these teenagers. “If we wait for politicians to actually do what they promised for so long already, we will wait
        a long time. It’s up to us. We work with the youngest generation, because I believe these teenagers are like spring.
        They are the ones who can let Ukraine blossom, who will be defining our society in 15 years. Therefore we should
        inspire them now. Once they are more confident about themselves and their country, they will strive to develop a
        better society. And we will all benefit from it.”
