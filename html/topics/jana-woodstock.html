        Kyiv has a special vibe that is hard to find anywhere else, believes DJ Jana Woodstock. The frail platinum blonde with the
        penetrating look grew up in the German city of Hannover. When she moved back to Kyiv at the age of 14, she had a
        hard time adapting to the language and culture of her motherland. “Everything was different: the way of thinking
        and looking at things, the feeling of life, the humour. In Ukraine the jokes are darker, but that actually suits
        me”, Jana says while effortlessly climbing the steep mountain road at Andreevsky Descent, in the Old Town. On top
        of the hill, hidden between the trees, is a centuries-old pagan cemetery; one of her favorite spots in the city.

        “When I am standing here, looking over the city, I really feel Kyiv. I find this a very inspirational place. Connecting with
        nature is very important to me. With my music I want to transmit the power that this place gives me to the people
        in the club.”

    <h2>Berlin wall</h2>
    <p>
        Every weekend, she’s playing dark techno - “I don’t do funny music” - at one of Kyiv’s many underground parties - Jana calls
        herself a “real Kyiv girl”. “Germany is still my home too, but I am aware of how little worries people have over
        there. They find themselves in such comfortable positions that they feel less of an urge to be truly inventive, it
        seems. In Kyiv the creative drive is bigger. Our government does not support us, so we do everything ourselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Most often a big electronic music scene develops itself in parallel to political events. Look at Berlin in the ‘90s: after
        the Wall fell, DJs from all over the world played at legendary clubs such as Tresor. I believe you can compare the
        current atmosphere of Kyiv’s club scene and how it has developed after Euromaidan with that period right after the
        Berlin Wall came down.Today DJs from all over the world are asking me to arrange a gig for them in Kyiv. It seems
        like everybody wants to play here now; it’s crazy.”

        Having been a city with “only clubs for daddies and gangsters”, as Jana puts it, Kyiv is now hyped as Europe’s newest “rave
        capital”. Many hip online magazines have even declared that the Ukrainian capital has pushed Berlin off its throne.
        But according to Jana, that’s rather exaggerated. “Maybe in a year or five we will be a hotspot for party tourism
        like Berlin, but at the moment we are not being flooded by foreign ravers. That’s what I appreciate so much about
        the scene here; it is developing one step at a time, not rushing anything."

    <h2>Superstars</h2>
    <p>
        Jana’s own DJ career on the other hand, took off unexpectedly fast. Her friend and agent Masha (29) played an important role
        in this. Masha co-founded Club 56, a club where young, emerging DJs got a chance to build up some experience, contributing
        to “a new wave of Kyiv DJs”, as Masha calls it. “Four years ago Jana played her first set there. Since then she’s
        gotten quite popular.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Jana: “It was crazy, because I actually played quite badly in the beginning. I had no idea what I was doing; I learned how
        to play while I was already behind my booth in the club. By day I was working in a bar, by night DJ’ing. It was a
        very nervous time for me.”

        Club 56 has now closed, but today Jana is DJ-in-residence at Osnova; a series of parties organized by her friend and agent
        Masha. Together with a few friends, Jana and Masha head for Otel’; the club where the Osnova parties mostly take
        place. Tonight, like most nights, there are only Ukrainian names on the bill. “Before this was mostly because of
        organisational problems: the weak
        <i>hryvnia</i>
        <small>[the Ukrainian currency]</small> and visa stress
        <small>[travel between Ukraine and the EU was not visa-free until June 2017]</small> made it impossible to invite a lot
        of foreign DJs,” Jana explains. “But in the meantime we transformed this limitation into an asset: we don’t need
        to fly in superstars for a successful party, our own music and DJs are more than good enough.”

    <h2>Tolerance towards ravers</h2>
    <p>
        Shortly after midnight, the industrial lot at Nyzhnoiurkivska Street slowly fills up with stylish youngsters who discuss
        where to spend their night, over a cigarette. The lot accommodates several clubs that didn’t exist five years ago.
        “It is hard to start a new club and keep it running. The government does not support it and raves are not very popular
        among private property owners,” Masha explains.

        “But compared to Russia, where the police can shut a party down anytime they want, our government is quite tolerant towards
        ravers,” Jana adds. In Ukraine, president Poroshenko recently implemented a law that forbids such raids, as a reaction
        to an incident that took place last autumn. Special forces raided the now closed club
        <i>Jugendhub</i>, looking not only for drugs, but also for conscientious objectors to military service. Since the start
        of the war in 2014, all Ukrainian men over 18 who are not studying, are obliged to serve in the army. Masha: “The
        government understood that young people need raves to take off the pressure once in a while. And after all, they
        have bigger priorities at the moment.”

    <h2>Zoo</h2>
    <p>
        A seemingly lost Liverpool supporter taps her on the shoulder. The Champion’s League final brought him to Kyiv for the very
        first time, he explains, slurring his words. Where can he be entertained over here?, he asks. Masha kindly directs
        him to another club. “The rise in international interest in Ukraine is a good thing, I believe. Through this, our
        DJs get more followers, and I can get new clients.”

    </p>

    <p>
        Masha thinks for a while, scratching her short bob with a long, black-painted nail. “But there’s also a downside to all this
        attention: Ukraine is often still perceived as a cheap country with crazy people. But we are no zoo that you can
        come visit.”
