        Kyiv has a special vibe that is hard to find somewhere else, believes DJ Jana Woodstock. The frail platinum blond with the
        penetrating look grew up in the German city of Hannover. When she moved back to Kyiv at the age of 14, she had a
        hard time adapting to the language and culture of her motherland. “Everything was different: the way of thinking
        and looking at things, the feeling of life, the humor. In Ukraine the jokes are darker, but that actually suits me”,
        Jana says while effortlessly climbing the steep mountain road at Andreevsky Descent, in the old town. On top of the
        hill, hidden between the trees, is a centuries-old pagan cemetery; one of her favorite spots in the city.

        “When I am standing here, looking over the city, I really feel Kyiv. I find this a very inspirational place. Connecting with
        the nature is very important to me. With my music I want to transmit the power that this place gives me to the people
        in the club.”

    <h2>Berlin wall</h2>
    <p>
        Now she’s playing dark techno - “I don’t do funny music” - at one of Kyiv’s many underground parties every weekend, Jana
        calls herself “a real Kyiv girl”. “Germany stays my home too, but I am aware of how little worries people have over
        there. They find themselves in such comfortable positions that they feel less the urge to be truly inventive, it
        seems. In Kyiv the creative drive is bigger. Our government does not support us, so we do everything ourselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Most often a big electronic music scene develops itself parallel to political events. Look at Berlin in the nineties: after
        the wall fell, DJ’s from all over the world played at legendary clubs such as Tresor. I believe you can compare the
        current atmosphere of Kyiv’s club scene and how it developed since Euromaidan with that period right after the Berlin
        wall came down.Today DJ’s from all over the world are asking me to arrange a gig for them in Kyiv. It seems like
        everybody wants to play here now; it’s crazy.”

    <p>
        From a city with “only clubs for daddies and gangsters”, as Jana puts it, Kyiv is now hyped as Europe’s newest “rave capital”.
        Many hip online magazines even declared the Ukrainian capital to have pushed Berlin from its throne. But according
        to Jana that’s rather exaggerated. “Maybe in a year or five we will be a hotspot for party tourism like Berlin, but
        at the moment we are not being flood by foreign ravers. That’s what I appreciate so much about the scene here; it
        is developing one step at a time, not rushing anything."

    <h2>Superstars</h2>
    <p>
        Jana’s own DJ career on the other hand took off unexpectedly fast. Her friend and agent Masha (29) played an important role
        in it. Masha co-founded Club 56, a club where young, new DJ’s got a chance to build up some experience, contributing
        to “a new wave of Kyiv DJ’s”, as Masha calls it. Four years ago Jana played her first set there. Since then she’s
        gotten quite popular.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Jana: “It was crazy, because I actually played quite bad in the beginning. I had no idea what I was doing; I learned how
        to play while I was already behind my booth in the club. By day I was working in a bar, by night DJ’ing. It was a
        very nervous time for me.”

        Club 56 is closed today, but Jana is now DJ in resident at Osnova; a series of parties organized by her friend and agent
        Masha. Together with a few friends Jana and Masha head for Otel’; the club where the Osnova parties mostly take place.
        Tonight, like most nights, there’s only Ukrainian names on the bill. “Before this was mostly because of organisational
        problems: the weak hryvnia (the Ukrainian currency) and visastress (only since June 2017 traveling between Ukraine
        and the EU is visa-free) made it impossible to invite a lot of foreign DJ’s”, Jana explains. “But in the meantime
        we transformed this limitation into an asset: we don’t need to fly in superstars for a successful party, our own
        music and DJ’s are more than good enough.”

    <h2>Tolerance towards ravers</h2>
    <p>
        Shortly after midnight the industrial lot at Nyzhnoiurkivska Street slowly fills up with stylish youngsters who discuss where
        to spend their night over a cigarette. Because this lot accommodates several clubs that didn’t exist five years ago.
        “It is hard to start a new club and keep it running. The government does not support it and raves are not very popular
        among private property owners”, Masha explains.

        “But compared to Russia, where the police can shut a party down anytime they want, our government is quite tolerant towards
        ravers”, Jana adds. In Ukraine, president Poroshenko recently implemented a law that forbids such raids, as a reaction
        to an incident that took place last autumn. Special forces raided the now closed club Jugendhub, thereby not only
        looking for drugs but also for avoiders of military service. Since the start of the war in 2014 all Ukrainian men
        above 18 who are not studying are obliged to serve in the army. Masha: “The government understood that young people
        need raves to take off the pressure once in a while. And after all, they have bigger priorities at the moment.”

    <h2>Zoo</h2>
    <p>
        A seemingly lost Liverpool supporter taps her on the shoulder. The Champion’s League finale brought him to Kyiv for the very
        first time, he explains, slurring his words. Where can he be entertained over here, he asks. Masha kindly directs
        him to another club. “The rise in international interest for Ukraine is a good thing, I believe. Like this our DJ’s
        get more followers, and I can get new clients.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Masha thinks for a while, scratches her short bob with a long, black-painted nail. “But there’s also a downside to all this
        attention: Ukraine is often still perceived as a cheap country with crazy people. But we are no zoo that you can
        come visit.”
