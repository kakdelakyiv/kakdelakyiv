        Tall, with big eyes and a shy smile, Sasha is one half of the “obscure dance music” DJ-duo Krossfingers. Having had gigs
        all over Europe - especially since the implementation of visa-free travel - they are more well-known abroad than
        in Ukraine. “With the money I get from these shows abroad I can live comfortably in Kyiv”, says Sasha, who also does
        some art direction and graphic design on the side.

        Sasha grew up in Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, which has, since the spring of 2014, been renamed as the People’s Republic
        of Luhansk - a self-declared territory governed by pro-Russian separatists. As he left the city to study in Kyiv
        he does not feel as touched by the war in the eastern Donbass region - “my home is Kyiv now” - as his dad, who had
        to sell his house and move to the West. Sasha’s grandmother is still living in Luhansk and regularly informs her
        family “how nice and beautiful” life in Luhansk People’s Republic is. Sasha: “As a child I was always intrigued by
        the intense political discussions between my grandmother, with her pro-Russian stance, and my father, an anti-Soviet.”

    <h2>Activated</h2>

    <p>
        Euromaidan was for Sasha a great moment of civic power; he consistently refers to it as The Revolution. “Me and a lot of
        friends felt obliged to take part. The feeling that we actually could change something installed hope for a better
        future. Since the revolution, young people feel more European.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Since the revolution I am more conscious about the society I live in. I am following politics more closely because of it.
        I understand now that the war in the east of Ukraine will only end if Russia decides so. Therefore I started following
        different Russian media-outlets, to search for clues. Just like me many others became more active: today people no
        longer wait for the government to help them if they need something. They will repair their own roofs, clean their
        own streets, create their own cultural spaces.”

        One of these initiatives is 20ft Radio: an independent pirate radio station founded at the end of 2016, on which Sasha regularly
        plays live-sets. The radio station is named after its location, as it is situated in a cargo container on the industrial
        lot of Nyzhnoiurkivska Street together with nightclubs such as
        <i>Closer, Mezzanine</i> and
        <i>Otel’</i>.

        David Shamiev (29), a friend of Sasha and one of the hosts of 20ft Radio explains: “The goal is to give alternative DJs and
        musicians a platform and integrate them more into Kyiv’s musical scene, which is mostly techno-orientated at the
        moment. At the same time we want to inspire people to try and create something new. We still find ourselves at a
        very low, DIY level in comparison to many European web-radio’s. Kyiv’s electronic music scene is only five years
        young; we still lack a lot of experience and knowledge. But it won’t be long before we catch up with the EU, I’m
        sure.”
        <br>“Ukraine’s musical education started later than in Western countries because of the societal challenges all ex-Soviet
        countries went through in the ‘90s,” Sasha adds.

    <h2>Wilder, younger, fresher</h2>

    <p>
        Sasha believes Ukraine’s future is brighter, thanks to Euromaidan. “Actual changes are happening; very slowly perhaps, but
        surely they are happening. I’m optimistic that this government is not as cynical as the previous one. The process
        of integrating Ukraine in to the EU has started, but it will take some time. Maybe it will not happen within the
        next five years, but I’m quite confident that it will happen. Borders are no maintainable concept in the 21st century.”

    <p>
        As well as making him more optimistic, Euromaidan also made Sasha proud of his country.Though he is quick to emphasise his
        pride is a different kind of pride than that of Russia. “I just feel that I am part of something good now.”
    </p>

    <p>
        His new-found pride is mirrored by the increasing foreign interest in Kyiv as a tourist destination. “For many people in
        the West we are the new, unknown territory. I’ve heard many times everything here is a bit wilder, younger, fresher;
        especially the parties. There’s nothing comparable in the West.”
