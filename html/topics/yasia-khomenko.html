    <h2>
        Yasia Khomenko (29), fashion designer
    </h2>

    <p>
        A petite woman with a huge imagination: no description fits fashion designer Yasia, born and raised in Kyiv, better. After
        graduating from the Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design almost eight years ago, Yasia started her
        own label,
        <i>RCR Khomenko</i>. Her second collection won a Harper’s Bazaar Award, and she has showed at Fashion Weeks in London,
        Shanghai, Saint-Petersburg, and, of course, Kyiv.

    <p>
        In the middle of Kyiv’s Old Town, across from the charming St. Andrew’s Church, Yasia has set up her studio. She likes the
        creative vibe of the historical neighbourhood with its steep alleyways and cobblestones. She also lives nearby, together
        with her mother.

        Yasia’s colourful designs are made from both recycled and new fabrics. For each collection she playfully immerses herself
        in another reality. “When I was working on a collection with influences from the American South, I imagined myself
        to be the owner of a plantation,” Yasia explains from behind her messy drafting table. “I was walking the streets
        in big sunglasses, imagining all the people that crossed my path to be my slaves. Really interesting.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Somehow; Yasia still inhabits the imaginative world of the Scandinavian fairy tales that first triggered her creativity as
        a child. Every collection of hers is a new invitation to join her in her dream world.

    <h2>
        Only way of surviving
    </h2>

    <p>
        A bigger contrast between the friendly universe of RCR Khomenko and the brutal events of Euromaidan, which took place only
        one kilometre away from the studio, is almost impossible. At first Yasia took part in the protests, but after the
        massacre of 20 February 2014, in which security forces used live ammunition against protestors, she needed some distance.

        “In order to stay sane, I took a step back. You could call it cynical, but it was the only way of surviving for me”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “I was watching everything live on television and I just couldn’t believe my eyes. It was too much to process. So in order
        to stay sane, I took a step back. You could call it cynical, but it was the only way of surviving for me.”
        <br>Nonetheless Yasia would not describe herself as apolitical. “I still very much believe that Ukraine should become
        part of the European Union. For me Europe stands for tolerance. I don’t appreciate the xenophobic, patriarchal voices
        gaining influence and power in Ukraine now. My personal resistance is to just keep on living in my own world.”

    <p>
        Growing up in an artistic, anti-Soviet, pro-American family, constructing your own creative world instead of accepting the
        borders of the real world was strongly encouraged. During Soviet times Yasia’s father secretly worked as a photojournalist
        for American media. At home they spoke Ukrainian, because it was the anti-Soviet language.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yasia: “I grew up without any borders, my parents taught me that I could and should create my own reality. Of course I am
        Ukrainian, you can hear it when I speak, but I don’t like to identify as Ukrainian. Because for me any kind of identification
        with a concrete object or idea stands for a boundary. And I don’t want to limit myself.”
    </p>

        “Of course I am Ukrainian, you can hear it when I speak, but I don’t like to identify as Ukrainian. I don’t want to limit
        myself”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Compromising on her creative ideals is also something that Yasia just does not consider as an option. “Five years ago I could
        be as free and experimental in my work as I wanted, because people would buy my crazy dresses anyway. Even though
        I am selling less of those dresses than I used to, I am still making them today. All the same, I have to focus more
        on my casual line today.”
    </p>

    <h2>Ethno-branding bullshit </h2>
    <p>
        The city of Kyiv, where Yasia has lived all of her life, is crucial to her creative inspiration, she believes. “I could not
        live or work anywhere else. This city fills me with energy; I feel a strong connection to it.”
        <br> She feels her beloved Kyiv has changed a lot since Euromaidan, for better and for worse. “The international attention
        the city received was a good thing. Both for the perception of Kyiv and for our own self-esteem. Of course this has
        already been commercialised into ethno-branding “Made In Ukraine” bullshit, but I don’t feel like being part of that.
        The same goes for the current post-Soviet hype in the international fashion world. Since the Soviet regime didn’t
        really affect my childhood, I keep far away from this label. In general I don’t appreciate this style, because a
        lot of young people use these Soviet symbols without having experienced that period, so it feels dishonest. And honestly,
        this whole post-Soviet thing is just like a zoo for the West.”
